                <h2>Father of Indian Constitution</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. B. R. Ambedkar</b> was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer and political leader who
                    headed the committee
                    drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice
                    minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after
                    renouncing Hinduism. Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied
                    economics at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927
                    and 1923 respectively and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either
                    institution in the 1920s.

                    He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career,
                    he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities;
                    he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals,
                    advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the
                    establishment of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions
                    of Dalits.
